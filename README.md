## Overview
This repository gathers educational implementations of Machine Learning algorithms, focusing on practical learning and understanding of fundamental concepts. Each implementation works with a specific dataset and is designed to be easily understandable and modifiable.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib.

## Installation
To clone the repository, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/valentinarias-dtsc/machine_learning_implementation.git
cd machine_learning_implementation
```

Then, make sure you have a virtual environment activated (optional but recommended) and run:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
```

To install the project dependencies, use pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Datasets
|Name|Description|Main variables|
|----|-----------|--------------|
|dataset_regresion|Synthetic dataset with features to help explore models|'X', 'y'|

## How to Run
To run the implementations, open the notebooks in the `notebooks_en/` folder with Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab. Note that you can choose between the Spanish version (`notebooks_es/`) and the English version (`notebooks_en/`). There, comments and markdown will guide you through each step of the Machine Learning process.
